## You know what but why tho? 

I recently moved into a shared apartment in New Haven, my room being in the converted attic of a beautiful old house. After I had hauled my couch, desk, and other belongings up
the three flights of stairs and my body had a chance to cool down, I sat admiring my new abode and immediately noticed that the room was cold. Very cold.  

The next day I went to Walmart and bought an oil-filled electric radiator, and found that while it was perfectly capable of making my large room nice and toasty, it took about an hour to do so. I 
wished I could start the radiator remotely from my phone so that I could turn it on about an hour before I left home from work. This was the perfect opportunity to finally start 
that cute little smart home project that's a rite of passage for all Linux / embedded enthusiasts.
